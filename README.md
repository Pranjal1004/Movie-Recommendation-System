# Movie-Recommendation-System

This is a Content-Based Recommender System that recommends movies similar to the movie user likes.

# Files Description:
1. I have done the preprocessing of data in 4 stages in 4 separate files:
    1. The file "preprocessing movie data up to 2016 (1).ipynd" is jupyter source file where all the preprocessing of movie
          data upto the year 2016 is done and then saved in the CSV file "movie_data.csv".
    2. Similarly, the file "preprocessing movie data up to 2017 (2).ipynd" is another file where the preprocessing of movie
          data for the year 2017 is done and then that data is appended to the already preprocessed data of movies up to 2016, and then saved in new CSV file 
            "movie_data_upto_2017.csv".
    3. Similarly, "movie_data_upto_2021.csv", and "movie_data_upto_2022_march.csv" contain preprocessed data up to 2021 and 2022 respectively.
2. After this in the "main.ipynb" file I have used the final preprocessed data "movie_data_upto_2022_march.csv" to recommend movies using cosine similarity.
3. Then in the file "Sentiment Analysis.ipynb", I performed the sentimental analysis using the data from the "reviews.txt" file. The model that I have used is "Multinomial Naive Bayes".
   
# Similarity Score
It is a numerical value ranging between zero to one which helps to determine how much two items are similar on a scale of zero to one. This similarity score is obtained by measuring the similarity between the text details of both items. So, similarity score is the measure of similarity between given text details of two items. This can be done by cosine-similarity.

# How does Cosine Similarity Work?
Cosine similarity is a metric used to measure how similar the documents are irrespective of their size.
Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.
The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance
(due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together. The smaller the angle, the higher the cosine similarity.
